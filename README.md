# RP Tree

RP Tree is a command-line tool to generate a directory tree diagram.

## Run the App

Create a Python virtual environment and run the application:

```sh
$ python3 tree.py /path/to/directory/
```

**Note:** The `-h` option provides help on how to use RP Tree.

## Current Features

If you run RP Tree with a directory path as an argument, then you get the full directory tree printed on your screen. The default input directory is your current directory.

RP Tree also provides the following options:

- `-v`, `--version` shows the application version and exits
- `-h`, `--help` show a usage message
- `-d`, `--dir-only` generates a directory-only tree
- `-o`, `--output-file` generates a tree and save it to a file in markdown format
